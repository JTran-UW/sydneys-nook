                <p>I resolved to start writing.  Every day, every week, every year--it didn’t matter, just write.  The only thing I knew that would keep me accountable was publicity, an audience.  Just knowing one person could happen upon my internet pitstop keeps the words flowing from my little desk in Seattle.

                    <br><br>The subline is a reference to Virgina Woolf’s novel A Room of One’s Own.  It concerns a woman’s need for independent space--physical, mental, emotional--to write and express herself.  In this digital world, I figure a website, an online room of my own, only makes sense.
